# Taco PHP Documentation

## Introduction
Taco PHP is a lightweight PHP starter kit for building short, purposeful web shorts. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. Taco PHP is perfect for "1 hour startup build" kind of thing.

## Installation
Just clone this repo.

## License
Do whatever! Go Ham!

## Future
I'll add more features as I work on more projects.

## Heads Up
I built this so I could whip up a quick project without having to worry about doing the same thing over and over again. Not meant for production use. It's just a quick and dirty way to get something up and running.
